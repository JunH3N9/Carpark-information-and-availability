# python_assignment
Year 1 assignment for PRG1 (python programming). Using the 3 given csv files, I was tasked to do make a simple application that allows users to rpocess HDB carpark availabilities. My application provides a display menu with all available features:
1. Display total number of carparks in 'carpark-information.csv'
2. Display all basement carparks in 'carpark-information.csv'
3. Read the carpark availability file provided by user
4. Print total number of carparks in the file given in option 3
5. Display carparks with no available lots
6. Display carparks with x% of available lots (provided by user)
7. Display carparks with x% of available lots (provided by user) with the address

Additional features:
8. Display all carparks in a location provided by user
9. Display carparks with the most parking lots and its relevant details
10. Generate an output file that combines the data of 'carpark-availability.csv' with its corresponding address, sorted by lots available
